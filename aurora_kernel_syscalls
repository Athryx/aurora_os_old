common struct definitions:
struct UserArray<T> {
	data: *const T,
	len: usize,
}
len is number of elements, not bytes
data must be properly aligned for the type it is pointing to

struct UserString {
	data: UserArray<u8>,
}
must point to a valid utf-8 string

struct UserPageArray {
	addr: usize,
	len: usize,
}
addr must be page aligned
len is number of pages

PrivFlags(usize)
a bitmask of syscalls that a process is allowed to make
bit 0-1 (spawn_priv):
0: process is forbidden from calling spawn
1: process can call spawn, but it cannot spawn a process which has privalidges that it itself does not have
2: process can call spawn, and can spawn a process with higher privalidges than itself
bit 2 (priv_any): allows process to set its privalidge to any arbritrary value, instead of only being able to revoke privalidges it already has

CapPriv(usize)
a bitmask representing the permissions of a capability
bit 0 (cap_read): allows reading of the object referenced by this capability
bit 1 (cap_write): allows writing to the object referenced by this capability

CapFlags(usize)
a bitmask representing the various properties of a capability
bit 0-1 (cap_priv): specifies the privalidges of a capability
uses bits 0-1 of the CapPriv type
// TODO: figure out if ports and maybe even normal memory should have a capability
bit 2-4 (cap_type): specifies what type of object the capability refers to
0: connection
1: reply
2: futex
3: shared memory
4: mmio memory
5: interrupt
6: port

// Process id
type pid = usize;

// Thread id
type tid = usize;

// Capability id
// when picking an id for a capability, the kernel ensures that the bottom 6 bits match the CapFlags that represent information about the capability
type Cap<T> = usize;
// in the documentation, generic types will be used to denote which functions can accept which types of capabilities
// the following generic traits will also be used:
trait Map {}
impl Map for SMem {}
impl Map for Mmio {}

trait Communicate {}
impl Communicate for Connection {}
impl Communicate for Reply {}


0: fn print_debug (a1: usize, a2: usize, a3: usize, a4: usize, a5: usize, a6: usize, a7: usize, a8: usize, a9: usize, a10: usize)
prints the characters specified in the arguments to the debug console
this syscall is only for debugging until I write a terminal emulator
each argument is a combination of 8 bit characters to print to the screen
the order the characters are printed is as follows:
lower number arguments are printed before higher numbered arguments (a1 before a2 before a3, etc)
least significant bytes in each argument are printed first (a1 bits 0-7, a1 bits 8-15, a1 bits 16-23, etc)

options:
bits 0-7 (debug_print_num):
specifies the number of characters to print (max 80 on x86_64)


1: fn spawn (name: usize, name_len: usize, priv: PrivFlags, pstate: *const SpawnStartState) -> (err: SysErr, pid: pid)
spawns a new process
must be a superuser process to call this syscall
{name} must point to a valid utf-8 string, and {name_len} is the length of this string in bytes
{priv} specifies the privalidges of the spawned process
{pstate} must be properly aligned and point to a valid SpawnStartState structure

{pstate} contains additional information used by spawn syscall, and is defined as follows:
struct SpawnStartState {
	entry: usize,
	mem_arr: UserArray<SpawnMemMap>,
	cap_arr: UserArray<Cap>,
}

{entry} specifies which address the process should start executing code from

{mem_arr} is an array of SpawnMemMap structs which specify memory to be mapped into the new process
SpawnMemMap is defined as follows:
struct SpawnMemMap {
	mem: UserPageArray,
	at_addr: usize,
	flags: usize,
}
{mem} specifies the memory pages from the calling process that should be mapped into the new process

if {at_addr} is non zero, spawn will try to map the memory at the specified address
{at_addr} must b page aligned

{flags} is a bitmask of flags and is define as follows:
bit 0 (read): allows reading of memory
bit 1 (write): allows writing to memory
bit 2 (exec): allows executing code from memory
bit 3 (no_copy):
specifies that spawn should map the memory, but not copy any data over from the calling process
if this bit is set, {mem} does not need to point to allocated memory, the length will be used to allocate new memory
this cannot be used with copy_on_write or move
// TODO
bit 4 (copy_on_write):
specifies that the memory should be copy on write, and will not be coppied until written to
this cannot be used with no_copy or move
// TODO
bit 5 (move):
move the memory pointed to to the new process, and unmap it from the current process
this cannot be used with no_copy or copy_on_write
bit 6 (protected):
the memory cannot be realloced
bit 7 (spawn_ptr):
push pointer to memory to the SpawnMemPtr array in the new process
when the new process starts, a pointer to the SpawnMemPtr array will be in rax, and the length in rbx
the order of elements in this array will be the same as the order of the elements in the input {mem_arr}
the SpawnMemPtr data structure is defined as follows:
struct SpawnMemPtr {
	mem: UserPageArray,
	flags: usize,
}

{mem} points to the mapped memory
{flags} is a bitmask of flags, with the following options:
bit 0 (read): allows reading of memory
bit 1 (write): allows writing to memory
bit 2 (exec): allows executing code from memory

{cap_arr} is an array of capabilities that will be shared to the new process
a pointer to this array will be put in rcx, and the number of smids will be put in rdx

// TODO: specify git layout
a pointer to the global information table, which can be used to obtain information about the system and read the time, is placed in rdi
the global information table is always 1 page in length

return value:
syserr code:
InvlPriv: calling process had insuficiant privalidges
InvlPtr: a pointer was not correctly alligned or did not point to valid memory,
or the lengths were to long and they passed over invalid memory
InvlVirtAddr: non cannonical pointer
OutOfMem: not enough memory to load new process
InvlId: capability in {cap_arr} is invalid

pid:
pid of new process


2: fn exit ()
terminates the calling process


3: fn set_priv (priv: PrivLevel) -> SysErr
sets the calling processes privalidges

options:
bit 0 (priv_any): if this bit is set, the calling process can set its privalidges to {priv}
otherwise, the new value is current_priv & {priv}

return value:
syserr code:
InvlPriv: priv_any was set, but the calling proess did not have the priv_any privalidge


4: fn thread_new (rip: usize) -> (err: SysErr, tid: tid)
creates a new thread and returns its id
the thread function should not return, it should call thread_block with destroy in order to terminate itself
thread new will set rsp to a valid stack and will set rip to the value passed in

return value:
err:
syserr code
tid:
thread id


5: fn thread_block (reason: usize, | nsec: usize | thread_id: tid) -> SysErr
blocks the calling thread with reason {reason}

reason:
0: yield, sets thread to running state and switches to another thread, if available
if no threads other than the idle thread are ready to run, the current thread will continue to run
1: destroy, switches to another thread and terminates the current thread
if another thread is waiting on this thread for a message reply, than that thread is unblocked
2: sleep, will sleep until {nsec} nanoseconds after boot
3: join, will block until thread with id {thread_id} terminates
any other number will do nothing

return value:
syserr code:
InvlArgs: invalid reason passed to thread_block


6: fn realloc (mem: usize, len: usize, at_addr: usize) -> (err: SysErr, mem: usize, len: usize)
allocates, rellocates, or frees memory pointed to by mem

if {mem} == 0:
	allocates {len} pages, returns pointer on succes or 0 on failure
	returns 0 if {len} == 0
if {mem} != 0 and {len} == 0:
	frees pages pointed to by {mem} and returns 1 on success or 0 on failure
if {mem} != 0 and {len} != 0:
	reallocates pages to have len {len} and returns pointer on success or 0 on failure
	if it fails, the original pages will still be allocated and must be freed later

if {at_addr} == 0, realloc will pick a suitable virtual address to allocae the memory at

if {at_addr} != 0, realloc will ensure that the allocated memory starts at address {at_addr}
if it cannot fit the memory at this address, it will fail
note: if realloc is allocing at a certain addrss, it may still fail even if there is enough space for {len} pages
this is because realloc may try to map more memory in the virtual address soace than specified by {len}
to ensure this doesn't happen, set the optsion realloc_exact

realloc will never allocate memory at virtual address 0

options:
bit 0 (read):
allows reading of memory

bit 1 (write):
allows writing to memory

bit 2 (exec):
allows executing instrcutions from memory

On x86, a page will always be readable, even if read bit is set to 0,
unless wrtie and exec are also set to 0, in which case realloc will just reserve
the virtual memory, and not actually allocate anything

read, write, and exec flags only affect the initial allocation of a memory zone
if memory is resized, the flags in the original allocation are used, and the read, write, and exec flags are ignored

bit 4 (realloc_exact):
0: returned memory could be longer then specified {len}
1: returned memory is exactly as long as {len}
specifieng this option could lead to wasted physical memory

return value:
err:
syserr code
mem:
pointer to start of memory, or 0 if all memory was freed or there was an error
len:
length of memory allocated in pages, this is guarenteed to ba at least {len} pages long,
but it could be longer than specified, unless the realloc_exact option is specified


7: fn mprotect (addr: usize) -> usize

clones the capability {cap} with different privalidges

options:
bit 0-1 (mmio_cap_flags): CapPriv representing privalidges of new capability
these privalidges are anded with the privalidges {cap} already has, so clone can only create capabilities with the same or less privalidges as the original

return value:
syserr code:
InvlId: no capability with cid {cap} exists
InvlPriv: calling process had insuficiant privalidges to call this syscall

cap2: cid of new capability


12: fn cmap<T: Map> (cap: Cap<T>, at_addr: usize) -> (err: SysErr, addr: usize)

if {at_addr} is not 0, cmap will try to map the capability into memory starting at {at_addr}

return value:
syserr code:
InvlPriv: calling process has insuficiant privalidges to call this syscall
InvlId: no capability with cid {cap} exists
InvlOp: the capability is already mapped into this process' address space, or the capability cannot be mapped into memory
InvlVirtMem: the value passed in for at_addr causes the mapped memory to overlap with other virtual memory

addr: address of mapped memory


13: fn cunmap<T: Map> (cap: Cap<T>) -> SysErr
unmaps memory mapped by cmap

return value:
