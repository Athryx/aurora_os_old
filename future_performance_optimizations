Kernel Heap:
implement a slab allocator

implement realloc instead of using default implementation
make the LinkedListAllocator not search a HeapZone if the average size of element is less than allocation size
(or some other calculation)
groe heapzones by 2 * previous size, instead of by constant size

scheduler:
use a no allocating min binary tree to store sleeping threads for faster unsleeping

overall:
find places where hashmaps can be used instead of binary trees to improve performance
